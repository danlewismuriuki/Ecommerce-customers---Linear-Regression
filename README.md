# Ecommerce-customers---Linear-Regression
The E-commerce Customer Dataset is a collection of data about customers of an online retailer. It contains information such as the average session length, time spent on the website and app, length of membership, and yearly amount spent by each customer. The data is likely being used to analyze the customer behavior and to gain insights into factors that influence the amount of money spent by customers. This information can be used to inform marketing strategies and to optimize the customer experience. The dataset may also be used to build a predictive model, such as a linear regression, to estimate the yearly amount spent by customers based on their behavior.
